Monk was a C++ assignment, I was tasked to create dungeon game with c++ i chose to do a command line game. The aim of the game is to reach the treasure room. on load of the game a map is randomly generated with a 5 x 5 grid of rooms the player is then placed in a random room and has to find the trasure room. certain rooms have monstors in where the player can attack or defend.
